2. Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple
of 5, between 2000 and 3200 (both included). The numbers obtained should be printed in a
comma-separated sequence on a single line.

Ans:-
for i in range(2000,3201):
    if i%7==0 and i%5!=0:
        print(i,end=',')
		

3. Write a Python program to accept the user's first and last name and then getting them printed in
the the reverse order with a space between first name and last name.

Ans:-
first = input('Please enter your first name ')
last = input('Please enter your last name ')
print(first[-1:-(len(first)+1):-1] + ' '+last[-1:-(len(last)+1):-1])


4. Write a Python program to find the volume of a sphere with diameter 12 cm.

Ans:-
pie = 3.141592
r = 12/2
v = 4/3*pie* r**3
print(' Volume of sphere is ', v)

Task 2:

1. Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma-separated numbers from console and
generate a list.

Ans:-
Sol1-
nums = input('Please enter comma seperated numbers ')
new_num = nums.replace(',','')
l = list(new_num)
print(l)

Sol2-
nums = input('Please enter comma seperated numbers ')
new_num = nums.split(',')
print(new_num)

Sol3-

n=[]
nums = input('Please enter comma seperated numbers ')
for i in nums:
    if(i!=','):
        n.append(i)
print(n)

2.Create the below pattern using nested for loop in Python.

Ans:-
Sol1-
for i in range(5,4,-1):
    for j in range(1,6):
        print(j*'*')
    for k in range(1,6):
        print((i-k)*'*')
  
Sol2-  
n = 5
for i in range(n,n-1,-1):
    for j in range(1,n+1):
        print(j*"*")
    for k in range(n-1,0,-1):
        print(k*"*")

3. Write a Python program to reverse a word after accepting the input from the user.
Input word: AcadGild
Output: dilGdacA

Ans:-
input_word = input('Input Word ')
print(input_word[-1:-(len(input_word)+1):-1])     



4.

Ques:-
Write a Python Program to print the given string in the format specified in the sample output.
WE, THE PEOPLE OF INDIA, having solemnly resolved to constitute India into a
SOVEREIGN, SOCIALIST, SECULAR, DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC and to secure to all
its citizens
Sample Output:
WE, THE PEOPLE OF INDIA,
having solemnly resolved to constitute India into a SOVEREIGN, !
SOCIALIST, SECULAR, DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
and to secure to all its citizens

Ans:-
a= '\n\t'
b = '!\n\t\t'
c = '\n\t\t'
s = f"WE, THE PEOPLE OF INDIA, {a} having solemnly resolved to constitute India into a SOVEREIGN,{b} SOCIALIST, SECULAR, DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC {c} and to secure to all its citizens"
print(s)
